      'Chandula is a multi-talented, dedicated, and enthusiastic engineering student I met in the faculty. He is a positive-minded student who is always willing to accept challenges and finish them successfully in a timely manner. He is not only focusing on the academic activities at the university. He is engaging in numerous extra-curricular activities in line with his academic activities. He immensely supported our department in successfully organizing the online guest lecture series called "INSPIRE" for the year 2023. Furthermore, his engagement with other extracurricular activities has provided him to improve his leadership skills and communication skills. He is demonstrating the traits of a competent engineer now as a student. I can recommend Chandula as a kind of all-rounder engineering student who possesses most of the employability skills expected by leading employers. I wish Chandula all the very best in his future endeavors',
